      <p>We’ve <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/what-are-skills-and-attitudes-successful-public-problem-solving">worked with leading innovators</a>
      from around the world to define the key skills and attitudes that help
      support innovation in the public sector. Focusing in on problem-solving
      and experimentation, this tool has been designed so that you can...</p>

        Our research has shown that successful experimentation and problem
        solving results in greater, sustainable impact when teams can
        demonstrate skills and behaviours in the following 3 areas...
      team_results:
        title: Team summary
        about_html: |
          <p>Below we’ve summarised all the results collected from your team.
          The guide below gives you an idea on how you might interpret and use these results as a team.</p>
        team_guide: Team Development Guide
        skills_by_area: Your teams skills by area
    new:
      about_html: |
        <p>Each of the 3 areas relates to a specific set of skills,
        activities and behaviours.</p>
        <p>These are rarely all found in one individual, and instead need to be
         present within a wider team. The challenge (and opportunity) is to
         combine them in ways that make the team greater than its individual
         members.</p>
        <p>You as an individual might still have a range of these skills
        (at varying degrees of strength and weakness) across all 3 areas or you
        may naturally gravitate to only 1 or 2 of them.<p>
    strong_skills:
      about_html: |
        <p>Let’s try and build up a picture of your skills so we can understand
        what strengths you bring to a team, and what your areas for development
        are.</p>
    weak_skills:
      about_html: |
        <p>Now <span class='bold'>select the 2 cards</span> which you think your
        colleagues would use to describe your least strong or least
        well-practiced skills.</p>
    strong_attitudes:
      about_html: |
        <p>In addition to skills, our research has also identified 9 attitudes
        that support successful experimentation and problem solving. These
        differ from skills in that you will have formed them over a greater
        period of time and they are more difficult to learn and develop.</p>

        your colleagues would most likely use to describe you.</p>

        <p>Before we let you see and compare your results with your team we'd
        like to find out a little more information about you.</p>
        <p>Collecting this information helps us to make your results more
        meaningful, but also furthers our understanding about the current
        position of skills and attitudes within the sector so we can best
        support it. Most fields are not mandatory but we'd be grateful
        for your participation.</p>

        in your team, helping identify any gaps that you may need to address or mitigate.</p>
