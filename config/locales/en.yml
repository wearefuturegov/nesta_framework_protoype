    intro_2_part_1: "We’ve "
    intro_2_part_2: "worked with leading innovators"
    intro_2_part_3: " from around the world to define the key skills and attitudes that help support innovation in the public sector. Focusing in on problem-solving and experimentation, this tool has been designed so that you can..."
    intro_3_point_1: "Make sense of our findings."
    intro_3_point_2: "Reflect on & test your own skills and attitudes."
    intro_3_point_3: "Compare your results with colleagues and build a picture for your team."

    step_1:
      about: "Our research has shown that successful experimentation and problem solving results in greater, sustainable impact when teams can demonstrate skills and behaviours in the following 3 areas…"
    step_2:
      about_1: "Each of the 3 areas relates to a specific set of skills, activities and behaviours."
      about_2: "These are rarely all found in one individual, and instead need to be present within a wider team. The challenge (and opportunity) is to combine them in ways that make the team greater than its individual members."
      about_3: "You as an individual might still have a range of these skills (at varying degrees of strength and weakness) across all 3 areas or you may naturally gravitate to only 1 or 2 of them."
    step_3:
      about_1: "Let’s try and build up a picture of your skills so we can understand what strengths you bring to a team, and what your areas for development are."
      about_2: "Look through each of the cards below and <span class='bold'>select the 5</span> which you think your colleagues would use to describe your strongest skills."
    step_4:
      about: "Now <span class='bold'>select the 3 cards</span> which you think your colleagues would use to describe your least strong or least well-practiced skills."
    step_5:
      about_1: "In addition to skills, our research has also identified 9 attitudes that support successful experimentation and problem solving. These differ from skills in that you will have formed them over a greater period of time and they are more difficult to learn and develop."
      about_2: "<span class='bold'>Select the 3 attributes</span> that you think your colleagues would most likely use to describe you."
    step_6:
      about: "Now <span class='bold'>select the 1 attribute</span> that you think your colleagues would be least likely use to describe you."
